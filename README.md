#    HTML Project - ODIN RECIPES

 In this project I put into practice the basic knowledge about
 HTML tags and elements, in order to build my first website of 
 the Foundations course.

 First, created an index.html file, adding to it the
 boilerplate HTML code, as well as an -h1- tag for the homepage.

 Then, created a page for Lasagna's recipe and linked it
 in the homepage.

 In the following step, added all the content to the lasagna
 recipe page, including an image of this dish and two sections
 with unordered lists: the ingredients section and the how it
 is made section.

 In the last section, included  more recipe pages, Spaghetti
 Bolognese and Minestrone, with the same characteristics as
 the lasagna recipe page. NOTE: Included more images, links
 and some basic CSS rules to these pages.
