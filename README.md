#    HTML Project - ODIN RECIPES
#
# In this project I put into practice the basic knowledge about
# HTML tags and elements, in order to build my first website of 
# the Foundations course.
#
# First, I created an index.html file and added the boilerplate
# HTML code, as well as an <h1> tag for the homepage.
#
# Then, I created a page for Lasagna's recipe and linked it
# in the homepage.
